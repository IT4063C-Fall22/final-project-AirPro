    "## Topic\n",
    "*What problem are you (or your stakeholder) trying to address?*\n",
    "The main topic of this project is to utilize my skill sets comprising of data analysis, machine learning, and data manipulation to determine where, when, why, and possibly how hate crimes, mental illness related to violent crimes, and psychological profiles of individuals with anti-social tendencies and a high potential propensity to commit crimes will occur based on available data from local, county, state, national, and global data from at least 3 different sources. The data must include these specific types that can be combined to form reliable conclusions and summations. To start I will attempt to develop models that are based on existing data. Maybe in the future, if there is a successfully analysis, I can begin to look at using real-time data to make my analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Question\n",
    "*What specific question are you seeking to answer with this project?* \n",
    "*This is not the same as the questions you ask to limit the scope of the project.* \n",
    "The questions this project is trying to answer is it possible to predict that a mentally ill person, that has affiliations with known hate groups, has a history of psychological problems, and has a criminal record of some type, can commit atrocities and mass murders or some type of mass public crime? Society has been looking for solutions to these social problems for a long time. Can data analytics make a significant difference? I believe it can if we can get past the delays in getting approval to access the data, and we can update the real-time data to the point that the current data represents current social conditions we might be able to avoid catastrophic events like mass murders and other criminal behavior. The key problem is relating the geographical regional data to the potential criminal elements that probably have some type of mental illness history and/or hate group affiliations of some type.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What would an answer look like?\n",
    "*What is your hypothesized answer to your question?* \n",
    "The primary data is either categorical or statistical in nature and it must be determined what information is the target from each data set and what attributes will make up those data sets. Statistical data might include the rate of murder per 100,000 individuals per year. Categorical data would look more like nationality, male or female, violent versus non-violent, or type of crime committed white collar, financial, rape, murder, misdemeanor, etc. Depending on this criterion the outcome for this project should be a verifiable and reliable projection of areas and individuals that are most prone to commit violence, express hate criminal behavior, and have had or has mental illness or a history of criminal behavior. With this information, it should be possible to watch or monitor those individuals at these times for such behavior. Then we night be able to prevent criminal activities that normally would not be avoidable. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Sources\n",
    "### *What 3 data sources have you identified for this project?* \n",
    "### Dataset One: Mental Illness and Fatal Shootings\n",
    "This dataset shows a relaionship between mental illness and the commision of violent crimes, specifically the crime of murder. This dataset also includes location. I believe it will provide some vital statistics and also categorical information of value in trying to determine who might commit a serious crime, where that person would do it, and when.\n",
    "### Dataset Two: Bias Ethnic Groups and Number of Criminal Incidents\n",
    "This dataset demonstrates that hate crimes are committed against ethic and racial groups. This is important when trying to find out what groups would be the most ikely to be targeted by hate groups, which have a lot of mentally ill individuals who also have a histroy of comitting crimes.\n",
    "### Dataset Three: Frequency of Mental Illness by Location\n",
    "This information might prove usefull in that there is a high probability that lower income areas have a distinctly higher rate of mental illness. And there might other characteristics of mental illness that are relevent to determining when, where, and why mass shootings might transpire. \n",
    "### Dataset Four: Living Wage State Capitols\n",
    "This dataset might shed some light on what type of family situation would be most likely to be under financial strain and might be prone to become mentally ill and then might tend to commit mass shootings and similiar crimes due to financial collapse and the individual becoming distraught and disconnected. Financial truoble leads to indiviudlas giving up and then stricking back against society. \n",
    "### Dataset Five: Mental Health Data\n",
    "This is a general look and mental health data and it might be informative when trying to understand how mental health is evaluated and how I can get valueable information that might be useful to my project.\n",
    "### Dataset Six: Predicting Hate Crimes\n",
    "This is very important information becuase hate crimes are not that far off from commitng mass shootings, the reasons these incidents coccur might be different, but I would venture to assume that many of the mass shootings include individuals that also have comitted hate crimes and belong to hate groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "### *How are you going to relate these datasets?*\n",
    "I am not exactly sure how these different datasets will be integrated to provide a picture of an individual that is probably mentally ill, that has a propensity to joi nhate groups, and has finanical trouble, and would be a loner that might commit mass shootings in a specific areas at specific times. That will be the real challenge. I believe I need to pull the relevant information and data from each dataset and collate it into a single dataset that can give me inshgts that I am looking for. \n",
    "### *How will you use this data to answer your project question?*\n",
    "Each dataset will add some relevant part of the total picture needed to make reasonable assertions that certain types of individuals will commit mass shootings at a specific time in a specific place. "
