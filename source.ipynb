    "## Topic\n",
    "*What problem are you (or your stakeholder) trying to address?*\n",
    "The main topic of this project is to utilize my skill sets comprising of data analysis, machine learning, and data manipulation to determine where, when, why, and possibly how hate crimes, mental illness related to violent crimes, and psychological profiles of individuals with anti-social tendencies and a high potential propensity to commit crimes will occur based on available data from local, county, state, national, and global data from at least 3 different sources. The data must include these specific types that can be combined to form reliable conclusions and summations. To start I will attempt to develop models that are based on existing data. Maybe in the future, if there is a successfully analysis, I can begin to look at using real-time data to make my analysis?\n",

    "## Project Question\n",
    "*What specific question are you seeking to answer with this project?*\n",
    "*This is not the same as the questions you ask to limit the scope of the project.*\n",
    "The questions this project is trying to answer is it possible to predict that a mentally ill person, that has affiliations with known hate groups, has a history of psychological problems, and has a criminal record of some type, can commit atrocities and mass murders or some type of mass public crime? Society has been looking for solutions to these social problems for a long time. Can data analytics make a significant difference? I believe it can if we can get past the delays in getting approval to access the data, and we can update the real-time data to the point that the current data represents current social conditions we might be able to avoid catastrophic events like mass murders and other criminal behavior. The key problem is relating the geographical regional data to the potential criminal elements that probably have some type of mental illness history and/or hate group affiliations of some type.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What would an answer look like?\n",
    "*What is your hypothesized answer to your question?*\n",
    "The primary data is either categorical or statistical in nature and it must be determined what information is the target from each data set and what attributes will make up those data sets. Statistical data might include the rate of murder per 100,000 individuals per year. Categorical data would look more like nationality, male or female, violent versus non-violent, or type of crime committed white collar, financial, rape, murder, misdemeanor, etc. Depending on this criterion the outcome for this project should be a verifiable and reliable projection of areas and individuals that are most prone to commit violence, express hate criminal behavior, and have had or has mental illness or a history of criminal behavior. With this information, it should be possible to watch or monitor those individuals at these times for such behavior. Then we night be able to prevent criminal activities that normally would not be avoidable. \n",
